## ETF Analysis Application

The purpose of this project is to build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. I will analyze a single asset in the ETF portfolio, then I will analyze the portfolio as a whole.

## Technologies

This project will be coded in Python. We will also use SQL to run queries and hvplot to help visualize the data. Voila will also be used to deploy the Jupyter notebook as a web application. 

---

## Installation Guide

This application was built in a Jupyter notebook, and the code is fully executed. To view the Jupyter notebook as a deployed web application on your local machine, simply run all of the cells in the notebook. The final cell contains the voila code that will deploy the notebook locally on your machine. No other technologies are needed to view and run the code.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook will already be fully executed upon opening. The following screenshot is an example of what the application looks like when it is deployed to your local machine by using voila. You can see the cursor hovering over the last plot and the data that is associated with the point that the cursor is on, confirming that the app is deployed and functioning as a web app properly:
